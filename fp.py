# The point of this assignment is not to use the functional elements that are part of your chosen language (JavScript/Python).
# But, rather, implement the functionality from scratch using pure functions and higher level functions.
# Do the implimentation in order as given. 
# We have linked to info at MDN, this is just to give a sence of how the reduce,forEach,map and filter functions should work.
#
# üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisite:
# You must create an array persons that will contain the data from https:#raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-203/misc/main/data/data.json
# This must be done before the first task
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bonus challenge üéâ (a bit hard), the functions forEach, filter and map can all be created using the function reduce. 
# If you feel up for a challenge, try doing so. NB! The bonus challenge is optional. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1
# Implement your own reduce function and count the number of people above the age of 50
# You can read about a reduce function https:#developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce 

print("Task 1:")


# 2
# Implement your own forEach function and use it to greet all the people in the persons array (say Hi, persons name).
# Read about forEach https:#developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
print("Task 2:")
pairs = dict([tuple(names[i:i+2]) for i in range(0, len(names), 2)])

# 3
# Implement your own map function and make everyone a year older.
# You can read about what the map function should do https:#developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map 
print("Task 3:")


# 4
# Implement your own filter function, and use it to find evryone under the drinking age.
# Read about filter https:#developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
print("Task 4:")


# 5
# Now create a function sum, that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum
# Try to use your previously created functions to make this function 
# Sum the total age of persons using this new function 
# NB! Do not manualy create the age listing
print("Task 5:")
totale_age = sum(pairs.values())
print("Totale age summed: %f" % (totale_age))

# 6
# Now create a function average, that returns the average of a list of numbers
# Try to use your previously created functions to make this function 
# calculate the average age of the persons using this function
# NB! Do not manualy create the age listing

print("Task 6:")
avg_age = sum(pairs.values())/ len(pairs)
print("Average age: %f" % (avg_age))


# 7
# Finaly create a max and a min function that respectivly returns the maximum value and the minimum value
# Only use previously created functions to acchive this.
# Then find the min and max age of ther persons.
print("Task 7:")
print(min(pairs.values()))
print(max(pairs.values()))
